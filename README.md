# Cybersecurity and Threat Detection Platform

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Cybersecurity and Threat Detection Platform in Java. The platform includes components for network monitoring, intrusion detection, and threat analysis.

## Components

1. **Network Monitor**: Captures network traffic data for analysis.
2. **Intrusion Detection**: Analyzes network traffic to detect potential intrusions or security breaches.
3. **Threat Analysis**: Analyzes detected intrusions and assesses potential threats to the system.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class to start the Cybersecurity and Threat Detection Platform.
2. The `NetworkMonitor` captures network traffic data.
3. The `IntrusionDetection` component analyzes the captured network traffic to detect intrusions.
4. The `ThreatAnalysis` component performs a deeper analysis of detected intrusions to assess potential threats.

## Example

```java
// Initialize components
NetworkMonitor networkMonitor = new NetworkMonitor();
IntrusionDetection intrusionDetection = new IntrusionDetection();
ThreatAnalysis threatAnalysis = new ThreatAnalysis();

// Capture network traffic
List<String> networkTraffic = networkMonitor.captureNetworkTraffic();

// Detect intrusions
List<String> intrusions = intrusionDetection.detectIntrusions(networkTraffic);

// Analyze threats
threatAnalysis.analyzeThreats(intrusions);

```

## Features

- **Network Monitoring**: Captures and monitors network traffic for potential security threats.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Analyzes network traffic patterns to detect suspicious activities or intrusions.
- **Threat Analysis**: Performs in-depth analysis of detected intrusions to assess potential threats to the system.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale and adapt to different network environments and security requirements.
